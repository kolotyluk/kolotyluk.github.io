I did my first 'pull request' today. Actually, I did one years ago, but I did not really
[grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) what was going on.

Following the various e-mail lists, forums, and other conversations people use the term
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) all the time as if
everyone knows what is meant by that, which can be a little daunting to people not familiar
with the concept.

The way I like to understand a pull request is that it is the beginning of a dialog on
improving a piece of software, documentation, or any other artifact you may have under
revision control. However, instead of complaining about a defect or asking for a feature
request, you have actually done the work yourself: after all, a picture is worth a
thousand words.

The pull request is the set of changes that are to be applied to a repository, along
with the comments explaining or justifying the reasons for applying the changes.
The person, or persons, with the ability to accept the changes and apply them to the
repository can read the comments, and see the specific differences between how the
repository is now, and what it will look like after. They can then decide whether or
not to accept the changes.

However, as I said earlier, this is a dialog, so the people with the authority to accept the
pull request can comment and ask questions if necessary. In fact, almost anyone can
comment and ask questions whether they have the authority to make the changes or not.
In this way, software development becomes a very democratic process, and the more eyes
on the software, the more likely people are to find defects, or offer up good advice on
making the software better.

I was watching a YouTube video years ago, about an employing at GitHub explaining why they
don't have meetings; instead they rely on pull requests. Meetings truly can be the bain of
any organization because the force synchronization, are expensive, and often waste people's 
time. Using an ansynchronus dialog such as pull requests, people can manage their time
better. One key concept I got from the video was "never pull a developer out of the zone."
That totally resonates with me as I cannot count the number of times I have been "in the zone"
working on a tough problem, then I have a meeting (or someone interrupts me), and when I
get back to the problem, I have 'paged out' my working set of thinking, and I have to rebuild
it, which can take a long time.

Generally executing a pull request is fairly simple, but it really helps to have a good
grounding in Git and GitHub first, and there are many way to learn that, but my favorite
is YouTube. However, compared to other methods I have used in the past with other software
revision control systems, issue tracking systems, etc., the GitHub pull request is by far
the most simple and effective I have seen yet.
