title:  "Open Source - What a Joke"

I always used to say: I wish I were independently wealthy, so I could be an open source developer.
Recenly I decided not to wait for wealth, but to just dive in and start doing it. April 1st seems
like as good a time as any to just do it. The joke is, I am such a newbie I have a hard time taking
myself seriously at being any good at this. One the other hand, I have been writing code since I was
12 years old, in 1970, so this is more like an old dog learning new tricks.

While I regularly use such drugs as YouTube, Kahn Acadamy, Google, FaceBook, StackTrace, etc.,
I have not found any good primer on getting into Open Source Software (OSS) yet. In a way, this
blog will be my primer on what I have learned.

Without going into the history of OSS, I will start with the present, on things I have learned:

1. Grok [Git](http://git-scm.com) & [GitHub](http://github.com)
2. Mind [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
3. Stalk [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

I could go on, but those are the three basics I have found to adopting an open attitude towards
software development.

# Git

OMG, why did it take so long to come up with something as beautiful and elegant as Git.
Over the years I have used Perforce (Subversion), CVS, and others. Git is like a gift from
heaven in how much more simple and elegant it is to use.

GitHub is really more like the cultural watering hole for open source developers.

# Maven

For years I had heard about Maven, and was often put off by the Maven zealots I percieved
everywhere. Finally, one day I decided I was going to stop ignoring Maven and just try using
it. To be sure, it was a painful experience, but eventually I became converted.

The most important thing to know about Maven is that if you try to do something that is not
the 'Maven Way' you will hurt yourself. But, if you give yourself over, heart and soul, to
Maven, your universe will be expanded immensely.

## Education

There are many ways to learn Maven, but in all my experience it is best to start with the
Grand Guru of Maven: [Russel Gold - Getting Started With Apache Maven](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-apache-maven/video)

From there, you should go to the [Sonatype Books](http://www.sonatype.com/resources/books)

After all that you will finally be ready for [Raw Maven](http://maven.apache.org)

# StackOverflow

If you are trying to solve software development issues, this seems to be the best place to
hangout and vistit regularly. All too ofent on Google searches, my answsers come up on
StackOverflow.
