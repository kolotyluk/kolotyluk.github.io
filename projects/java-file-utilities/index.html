  <h1>Java File Utilities</h1>

  <p>These are some utilities for file and file system handling.</p>
  <h2>Files.contentEquals(file1, file2)</h2>
  <p>
    While Apache already does this, this one is currently faster. By using Memory Mapped I/O it is about 4 times
    faster than the java.nio buffered I/O used by Apache.

    This project was inspired by another project I started many years ago, Find Duplicate Files, where I was
    creating a utlity to help me manage all my media files. Whey you are dealing with photos, music, and videos,
    often times you get duplicates of the same file. At the heart of finding duplicate files you ultimately need
    to compare files byte-by-byte to verify they have equal content.

    Experimentation showed that using Memory Mapped Files had the best performance.
