  <h1>Java File Utilities</h1>
  <a href="http://kolotyluk.github.io/java-file-utilities">Maven Site</a>
  <p>These are some utilities for file and file system handling.</p>
  <h2>Files.contentEquals(file1, file2)</h2>
  <p>
    While Apache already does this, this one is currently faster. By using Memory Mapped I/O it is about 4 times
    faster than the java.nio buffered I/O used by Apache.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project was inspired by another project I started many years ago, Find Duplicate Files, where I was
    creating a utlity to help me manage all my media files. Whey you are dealing with photos, music, and videos,
    often times you get duplicates of the same file. At the heart of finding duplicate files you ultimately need
    to compare files byte-by-byte to verify they have equal content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Experimentation showed that using Memory Mapped Files had the best performance. This is especially true for
    large files, such as music and video files. It also took some experimentation to determine how to compare
    memory mapped files as you do not want to load all the file contents at once. Basically, when you map in
    the files, you then want to do a byte-by-byte comparison of the files. Each time your code crosses a page
    boundary, the operating system will fetch a new page from the file system. Operating Systems try to optimize
    page-fault handling as much as possible, and while the initial setup may be a little costly, in the long run
    the complete comparison of two files this way is demonstrably the fastest possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe some day Apache and others will just copy my code, as they would not need to change their APIs to do so.
    The little gotcha I learned along the way was that when you are done with the memory maps, there is no easy way
    to unmap them. Not unmapping them leaves them locked, so you can't delete them or modify them while they are locked.
    Side effects such as this are very back, so I had to hack together some code from various sources to do this.
  </p>
  <h2>Files.cleanDirectByteBuffer(byteBuffer)</h2>
  <p>
    This code uses some reflection to access the lowlevel APIs not available publically. In my opinion, the jaba.nio
    APIs for memory mapped files are incomplete, and that makes it a design defect. Originally I thought about leaving
    this as s private method, but I figured other people might benefit from this solution as well--at least until
    the Java NIO team get their act together.
