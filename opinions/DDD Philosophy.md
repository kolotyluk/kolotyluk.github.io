# Domain Driven Design and Philosophy

<div style="padding: 16pt;font-size: 16pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
What I hope to convince you of is that there is solid philosophical support for DDD, and that
cultures that adopt it successfully, will be better science-based engineering cultures.

No, I am not an expert on [Domain-Driven Design][DDD Wikipedia] (DDD), but I like to connect the dots,
so I would like to cast DDD in the context of Philosophy; more specifically
[Bounded Contexts][Bounded Contexts - Eric Evans - DDD Europe 2020] in context of
[Ontology, epistemology and research paradigm], where a 'Bounded Context' is a 'Paradigm',
where a 'Domain' is a 'Bounded Context'.

## Collaborative Context

In the larger sense, I have worked on many projects in my career, and they are always lacking in the kind
of understanding I crave. In the game of [Chinese Whispers]

> Players form a line or circle, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear
> of the second person in the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on.
> When the last player is reached, they announce the message they heard to the entire group. The first
> person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass
> around the message without it becoming garbled along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless,
> this usually ends up happening. Errors typically accumulate in the retelling, so the statement announced
> by the last player differs significantly from that of the first player, usually with amusing or humorous
> effect. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, and the
> difficult-to-understand mechanism of whispering.

> The game is often played by children as a party game or on the playground. It is often invoked as a
> metaphor for cumulative error, especially the inaccuracies as rumours or gossip spread, or, more
> generally, for the unreliability of typical human recollection.

<div style="padding: 16pt;font-size: 16pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
    Every project I have ever worked on has been a game of Chinese Whispers.
</div>

Some more so, some less so... Indeed, a common problem of all collaborative efforts is establishing a shared understanding of what
we are collaborating on, and this is especially true in engineering projects, whether we are engineering
software or software systems. Do we all share the same [Domain Knowledge], and do we all share the same
[Methodology] and [Methods], in particular [Software Development Methodologies]?

In many organizations, most knowledge is [Tribal Knowledge][Tribal Knowledge Wikipedia]

> Tribal knowledge is any unwritten information that is not commonly known by others within a company.
> This term is used most when referencing information that may need to be known by others in order to
> produce quality products or services. The information may be key to quality performance, but it may
> also be totally incorrect. Unlike similar forms of artisan intelligence, tribal knowledge can be
> converted into company property. It is often a good source of test factors during improvement efforts.

When Tribal Knowledge is “totally incorrect,” I defined this as ‘*Tribal Lore*’ instead, because
‘knowledge’ is based on true facts, as we will see later. In practice, most organizations have a
blend of Tribal Knowledge and Lore. See also,
[my thoughts on Tribal Knowledge](Tribal%20Knowledge.md).



<div style="padding: 16pt;font-size: 16pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
Organizations and cultures that have well-defined domains, based on well-developed <em>‘realistic’</em>
knowledge, methodologies, and methods, that are <em>documented effectively</em>, are more science-based;
whereas the opposite would be less science-based.

According to Martin Fowler,

> [Domain-Driven Design][DDD Martin Fowler] is an approach to software development that centers the
> development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules
> of a domain.


# Research & Development

In [Ontology epistemology methodology and methods] we see that much of the discussion is in the context
of research, which is common for these philosophical concepts. In a sense, much of what any software
engineering company does is Research & Development, which should be familiar terms. We have methods and
methodology for defining, designing, and developing products. For example, tools like
[JIRA][JIRA Wikipedia] might be considered a methodology, while Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Bugs might
be considered methods used in that methodology. More accurately, JIRA is an instance of a methodology,
the methodology of issue-tracking.

## Epistemology

In understanding [Epistemology], we are trying to understand [Knowledge], and in doing so there are two
main schools of thought

1. [Epistemological realism]
   - “what can be known about an object exists independently of one's mind”
   - “the world exists independently and innately to our perceptions of it”
   - there is only one reality, and we all share it
   - the basis for scientific knowledge
3. Relativism
   - there can be more than one interpretation of reality
