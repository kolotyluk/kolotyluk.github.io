Programming since 1970 in a Computer Mathematics class in Grade 8, I have had a love/hate relationship with
computers, computer technology, and technology in general. Indeed, the more experience I get, the more
opinions I get, but like wave physics, sometimes those opinions reinforce, and other times those opinions
cancel out.

Generally these GitHub repositories are for what I would call *Recreational Programming* where I like to
play around with ideas. In another sense, in my professional life, it's nice to have a place to go back
to and see how I have solved various problems in the past. Finally, in a professional sense, this is
my portfolio where people can see various examples of the kind of work I have done.

## Opinions

Years ago someone gave me the book [Joel on Software], which I enjoyed tremendously. Not that I agreed with
everything [Joel Spolsky] had to say, but he certainly challenged me to think about things, he told me things
I did not know before, he inspired me to learn more about things I did not know. It is in the same spirit that
I share my opinions.

- [Are we Artisans or Hackers?](opinions/Artisans.md)
  - When I started my career, I always saw my colleges and myself as artisans; we crafted software and
    systems, often with a lot of aesthetic value. These days, with Agile practices, Scrum, Sprints, etc.,
    It feels more like the [Industrial Revolution], or the Ford [Assembly Line].
- [Cucumber in Practice](opinions/Cucumber.md)
  - As a newbie using Cucumber and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), this turned out to be harder than
    I expected.
- [Philosophy of Domain Driven Design](opinions/DDD Philosophy.md)
  - Not what you think... this is more about how I personally fit DDD into the metaphysics, knowledge,
    and other ideas in Philosophy.

## Random Thoughts

### Cognitive Bias

In "[Elon Musk Things Every Child Should Learn About These 50 Cognitive Biases]" there is the longest list of
Cognitive Biases I have ever seen; biases we are all susceptible to. Sometimes, increasingly actually, people
exploit these biases for propaganda, use them to exploit other people, generally to exploit others into acting
against their own best interests. In the worst cases, communities form an [Echo Chamber] to amplify these biases
and other deceptions. However, there also exist some people who value reality, who value understanding
reality, and feel it is better to utilize reality than to deny it.

# Projects

## [loom-lab](https://github.com/kolotyluk/loom-lab)

A place to learn about
[Project Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom)
through hands-on experimentation and exploration. See more at
[Project Site Pages](https://kolotyluk.github.io/loom-lab).

My hope is to develop this into a learning tool for other people as well, so if you have ideas on how
this can work better for you or others, please create a ticket in
[loom-lab Issues](https://github.com/kolotyluk/loom-lab/issues).
People are encouraged to `clone` this repo, run the experiments
and other code, make local changes, and watch what happens.
