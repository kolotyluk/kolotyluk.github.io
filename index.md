# GitHub Pages for Eric Kolotyluk

Programming since 1970 in a Computer Mathematics class in Grade 8, I have had a love/hate relationship with
computers, computer technology, and technology in general. Indeed, the more experience I get, the more
opinions I get, but like wave physics, sometimes those opinions reinforce, and other times those opinions
cancel out.

Generally these GitHub repositories are for what I would call *Recreational Programming* where I like to
play around with ideas. In another sense, in my professional life, it's nice to have a place to go back
to and see how I have solved various problems in the past. Finally, in a professional sense, this is
my portfolio where people can see various examples of the kind of work I have done.

## Opinions

Years ago someone gave me the book
[Joel on Software](https://books.google.ca/books?id=5qx2S47hnnEC),
which I enjoyed tremendously. Not that I agreed with everything
[Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky)
had to say, but he certainly challenged me to think about things. It is in the same spirit I share my
opinions.

# Projects

## [loom-lab](https://github.com/kolotyluk/loom-lab)

A place to learn about
[Project Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom)
through hands-on experimentation and exploration. See more at
[Project Site Pages](https://kolotyluk.github.io/loom-lab).

My hope is to develop this into a learning tool for other people as well, so if you have ideas on how
this can work better for you or others, please create a ticket in
[loom-lab Issues](https://github.com/kolotyluk/loom-lab/issues).
People are encouraged to `clone` this repo, run the experiments
and other code, make local changes, and watch what happens.
