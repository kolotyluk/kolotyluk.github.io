Programming since 1970 in a Computer Mathematics class in Grade 8, I have had a love/hate relationship with
computers, computer technology, and technology in general. Indeed, the more experience I get, the more
opinions I get, but like wave physics, sometimes those opinions reinforce, and other times those opinions
cancel out.
