# Tribal Knowledge

In many organizations, most knowledge is [Tribal Knowledge][Tribal Knowledge Wikipedia]

> Tribal knowledge is any unwritten information that is not commonly known by others within a company.
> This term is used most when referencing information that may need to be known by others in order to
> produce quality products or services. The information may be key to quality performance, but it may

When Tribal Knowledge is “totally incorrect,” I defined this as ‘*Tribal Lore*’ instead, because
‘knowledge’ is based on true facts, as we will see later.
